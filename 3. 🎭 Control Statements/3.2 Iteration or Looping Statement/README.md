### 3.2 Iteration or Looping Statement:

#### 3.2.1 `for` Loop:

ðŸŸ¢ The `for` loop executes a block of code repeatedly for a specified number of times.

```java
for (int i = 0; i < n; i++) {
    // Code to be executed in each iteration
}

3.2.2 while Loop:
ðŸŸ¢ The while loop repeats a block of code as long as a specified condition is true.

while (condition) {
    // Code to be executed as long as the condition is true
}


3.2.3 do-while Loop:
ðŸŸ¢ The do-while loop is similar to while, but it guarantees the execution of the block at least once.

do {
    // Code to be executed at least once
} while (condition);
