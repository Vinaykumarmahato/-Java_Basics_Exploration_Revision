### 3.1 Selection Statement (Conditional Statement):

#### 3.1.1 `if` Statement:

ðŸ”¹ The `if` statement allows you to execute a block of code if a specified condition is true.

```java
if (condition) {
    // Code to be executed if the condition is true
}

3.1.2 if-else Statement:
ðŸ”¹ The if-else statement enables the execution of different code blocks based on a true or false condition.

if (condition) {
    // Code to be executed if the condition is true
} else {
    // Code to be executed if the condition is false
}

3.1.3 Nested if Statement:
ðŸ”¹ Nested if statements involve implementing multiple conditional statements within each other.

if (condition1) {
    // Code to be executed if condition1 is true
    
    if (condition2) {
        // Code to be executed if both condition1 and condition2 are true
    }
}
3.1.4 switch Statement:
ðŸ”¹ The switch statement allows the selection of one code block from multiple based on the value of an expression.

int option = 2; // Example value

switch (option) {
    case 1:
        // Code to be executed if option is 1
        break;
    case 2:
        // Code to be executed if option is 2
        break;
    // Additional cases as needed
    default:
        // Code to be executed if none of the cases match
}
