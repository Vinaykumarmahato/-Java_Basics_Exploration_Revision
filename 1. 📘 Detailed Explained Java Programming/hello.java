 * Explanation:
 * 
 * Our code runs on a CPU, which is a semiconductor device composed of
 * transistors. Transistors are used to control the flow of electricity,
 * allowing for the representation of binary states. In digital systems, low
 * voltage corresponds to binary 0, and high voltage corresponds to binary 1.
 * 
 * Transistors, acting as switches, transition between low and high states.
 * While the actual voltage and current values may vary, the focus in digital
 * systems is on the binary representation. As software engineers, we leverage
 * this binary system by representing low and high states as 0 and 1,
 * respectively. This binary language forms the foundation of communication
 * between hardware and software, allowing the CPU to understand and execute
 * instructions in the form of 0s and 1s.
 * 
 * 
 * In Hindi:
 * 
 * hamara code ek CPU par chalta hai, jo ek semiconductor device hai aur isme
 * transistors ka use hota hai. Transistors electricity ka flow control karne
 * mein madad karte hain, jisse binary states ko represent kiya ja sake. Digital
 * systems mein, low voltage ko binary 0 ke saath joda jata hai, aur high
 * voltage ko binary 1 ke saath.
 * 
 * Transistors switches ki tarah kaam karte hain aur low aur high states ke
 * beech mein transition karte hain. Haan, asli voltage aur current values alag
 * ho sakti hain, lekin digital systems mein dhyan binary representation par
 * hota hai. Hum software engineers ke roop mein is binary system ka upayog
 * karte hain, jisme low aur high states ko 0 aur 1 ke roop mein darshaya jata
 * hai. Yeh binary bhasha hardware aur software ke beech ki communication ka
 * mool hai, jisse CPU ko instructions ko 0 aur 1 ke roop mein samajhne aur
 * execute karne mein madad milti hai.
 * 
 * Note:
 * the main reason of understanding the cpu only Binary digit 0's and 1's is because it has made by Transistor.

 * Let's talk about programming:
 * 
 * When we tell the computer what to do, it follows our instructions and gives
 * us results. If we use numbers like "001 100 1010," it's called machine
 * language, and the computer gets it directly.
 * 
 * But remembering lots of these codes is hard. That's where Assembly language
 * comes in. Instead of using numbers, we use words like "add" for adding and
 * "sub" for subtracting. It makes things a bit easier for us.
 * 
 * The problem is, the computer still doesn't get it because it only understands
 * 0s and 1s. So, we use a special tool called an Assembler to turn our words
 * into the computer's language.
 * 
 * Assembly language is not very easy for us, though. So, we made another
 * language called High-level language. It's like talking in sentences and is
 * easier for us to understand.
 * 
 * But guess what? The computer still doesn't understand. To help, we use a tool
 * called a Compiler to change our high-level language into the computer's
 * language.
 * 
 * I've attached a diagram in the same folder to make this idea clearer.
